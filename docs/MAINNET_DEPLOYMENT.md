# COMEBACKHERE Soroban Mainnet Deployment

Mainnet deployment must not run from a single local shell. The checked-in `scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh` intentionally refuses to deploy because live deployment requires governance approval, multi-sig signing, and a recorded signing ceremony.

## Preconditions

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (in `COMEBACKHERE-contracts/`)
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (in `COMEBACKHERE-contracts/`)
- `cargo test` (in `COMEBACKHERE-contracts/`)
- WASM artifacts built with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
- Admin, treasury, and compliance keys confirmed on Stellar mainnet
- AWS KMS or approved signing service configured for production signing
- Production USDC asset issuer verified against official Circle/Stellar documentation
- Mainnet Horizon and Soroban RPC health checks passing

## Required Environment Variables

- `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` — Soroban RPC endpoint (e.g., `https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org`)
- `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` — Network passphrase for mainnet signing
- `INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID` — Deployed invoice contract ID
- `TREASURY_CONTRACT_ID` — Deployed treasury contract ID
- `COMPLIANCE_CONTRACT_ID` — Deployed compliance contract ID

Set these via environment variables or in a `.env.mainnet` file. Scripts will fail fast if required variables are missing.

## Ceremony

1. Open a deployment issue with target commit SHA, expected WASM hashes, admins, and treasury signers.
2. Collect required multi-sig approvals.
3. Build release artifacts from a clean checkout of `COMEBACKHERE-contracts/`.
4. Verify WASM hashes match the deployment issue.
5. Submit deployment transactions through the approved signer.
6. Record transaction hashes and deployed contract IDs.
7. Update backend production secrets with:
   - `INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID`
   - `TREASURY_CONTRACT_ID`
   - `COMPLIANCE_CONTRACT_ID`
8. Run backend `GET /health/rpc` and a low-value end-to-end invoice payment smoke test.

## Abort Conditions

- Any signer mismatch
- Any WASM hash mismatch
- Soroban RPC health degraded across all configured endpoints
- Any failed low-value payment smoke test

## Multi-Sig Governance Model

All mainnet contract deployments and administrative operations require approval
from multiple authorized signers. No single individual can unilaterally deploy,
upgrade, or modify mainnet contracts.

### Signer Roles

| Role | Count | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Lead Deployer** | 1 | Prepares the deployment issue, builds release artifacts, submits the deployment transaction after all approvals are collected. Does NOT hold sole signing authority. |
| **Security Reviewer** | 1–2 | Reviews the target commit for security vulnerabilities, verifies WASM hashes match the audited source, and signs off on the security checklist. |
| **Treasury Signer** | 2+ | Holds custody of treasury signing keys. Must independently verify artifact hashes before co-signing the deployment transaction. |
| **Compliance Officer** | 1 | Confirms that the deployment meets regulatory requirements, verifies that the compliance contract configuration is correct, and signs the compliance attestation. |
| **Ceremony Witness** | 1 | Observes the signing ceremony, records the audit log, and confirms that all procedural steps were followed. Does not hold a signing key. |

### Signing Threshold

The treasury contract enforces an on-chain multi-sig threshold. A deployment
transaction requires signatures meeting or exceeding the configured threshold
weight. The default configuration is:

- **Threshold**: 3 of 5 signers (by weight)
- **Each signer weight**: 1 (equal weight, adjustable via `update_threshold`)
- **Minimum signers for quorum**: 3

The threshold can only be changed through a signed `update_threshold` transaction
that itself meets the current threshold.

### Key Custody Requirements

1. **Hardware wallets required** — All mainnet signing keys MUST be stored on
   hardware wallets (Ledger Nano S/X or equivalent). Software-only keys are
   not permitted for mainnet operations.

2. **Geographic distribution** — Signing keys must be held by individuals in at
   least two distinct geographic locations to mitigate single-site risk.

3. **No shared custody** — Each signer holds exactly one key. No key may be
   shared between individuals or stored in a shared location (e.g., shared
   password manager vault).

4. **Backup and recovery** — Each signer must maintain a secure offline backup
   of their recovery seed phrase, stored separately from the hardware wallet
   itself. Recovery procedures must be tested at least once before participating
   in a mainnet ceremony.

5. **Key rotation schedule** — Signing keys should be rotated every 12 months
   or immediately upon any suspected compromise. Use the
   `propose_signer_rotation` and `approve_signer_rotation` contract functions
   to execute rotations on-chain.

6. **Revocation** — If a signer is compromised or departs the organization,
   their key must be removed via a signed `set_signer` transaction within 24
   hours. The remaining signers must meet quorum to execute this.

## Mainnet Signing Ceremony Checklist

The signing ceremony is a structured process that ensures every mainnet
deployment is safe, auditable, and authorized by the required signers.

### Pre-Ceremony (Lead Deployer, 24–48 hours before)

- [ ] Open a GitHub deployment issue using the deployment issue template
- [ ] Include the target commit SHA from `COMEBACKHERE-contracts/`
- [ ] Build WASM artifacts from a clean checkout of the target commit:

  ```sh
  git clone --branch <TAG> --depth 1 <REPO_URL>
  cd COMEBACKHERE-contracts/
  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```

- [ ] Compute and record SHA-256 hashes of all WASM artifacts:

  ```sh
  sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/comebackhere_*.wasm
  ```

- [ ] Post the hashes in the deployment issue
- [ ] List the expected admin, treasury, and compliance public keys
- [ ] Tag all required signers for review
- [ ] Confirm Soroban mainnet RPC health:

  ```sh
  curl https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org/health
  ```

### Security Review (Security Reviewer, before ceremony)

- [ ] Pull the exact commit SHA from the deployment issue
- [ ] Run static analysis and linting:

  ```sh
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  ```

- [ ] Run the full test suite:

  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```

- [ ] Review all contract changes since the last mainnet deployment
- [ ] Verify no new dependencies were introduced without review
- [ ] Independently build WASM artifacts and confirm hashes match the
      deployment issue
- [ ] Sign off on the deployment issue with a security approval comment

### Compliance Review (Compliance Officer, before ceremony)

- [ ] Verify that the compliance contract configuration matches the
      approved address allowlist
- [ ] Confirm no regulatory-sensitive changes were introduced
- [ ] Sign the compliance attestation in the deployment issue

### Ceremony Execution (All signers, synchronous)

All signers must be present (in-person or via authenticated video call) for the
ceremony. The Ceremony Witness records each step.

1. **Roll call** — Confirm identity of all participating signers. Record
   attendance in the ceremony log.

2. **Artifact verification** — Each signer independently verifies:
   - The deployment issue commit SHA matches the checked-out source
   - WASM hashes match the deployment issue
   - The security review and compliance attestation are present

3. **Environment confirmation** — The Lead Deployer confirms:
   - `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` points to mainnet (`https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org`)
   - `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` is set to the mainnet passphrase
   - All required environment variables are set and verified

4. **Transaction construction** — The Lead Deployer constructs the deployment
   transaction(s) without submitting:

   ```sh
   stellar contract deploy \
     --wasm <WASM_PATH> \
     --network mainnet \
     --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
     --build-only
   ```

5. **Multi-sig collection** — Each Treasury Signer reviews the unsigned
   transaction and signs with their hardware wallet:
   - Verify the transaction destination, contract hash, and parameters
   - Sign using the hardware wallet
   - Pass the partial signature to the Lead Deployer

6. **Threshold verification** — The Lead Deployer confirms the collected
   signatures meet the on-chain threshold before submission.

7. **Submission** — The Lead Deployer submits the fully signed transaction to
   the Soroban RPC endpoint.

8. **Confirmation** — Wait for transaction confirmation. Record:
   - Transaction hash(es)
   - Deployed contract ID(s)
   - Ledger sequence number

9. **Post-deployment verification** — Run the following checks:
   - `GET /health/rpc` on the backend returns healthy
   - A low-value end-to-end invoice payment smoke test succeeds
   - Contract state queries return expected initial values

10. **Secret rotation** — Update backend production secrets with the new
    contract IDs:
    - `INVOICE_CONTRACT_ID`
    - `TREASURY_CONTRACT_ID`
    - `COMPLIANCE_CONTRACT_ID`

11. **Ceremony close** — The Ceremony Witness:
    - Records all transaction hashes in the deployment issue
    - Confirms all checklist items are complete
    - Closes the deployment issue with a summary comment

### Post-Ceremony (Lead Deployer, within 24 hours)

- [ ] Update `abis/` with the new contract metadata
- [ ] Open a PR to update ABI snapshots and any configuration references
- [ ] Notify the team in the designated channel that mainnet deployment is live
- [ ] Archive the ceremony recording (if video call) per retention policy

### Emergency Rollback

If a critical issue is discovered after deployment:

1. The Lead Deployer opens an emergency deployment issue
2. If the contracts support pause: execute `pause` via multi-sig to halt
   operations immediately
3. Follow the standard ceremony process for any corrective deployment
4. Document the incident in a post-mortem within 48 hours
